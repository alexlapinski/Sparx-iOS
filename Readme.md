# Sparx - Prototyp

So far, this is just a simple iOS application that has 2 modes:

## Generate QR Code
This asks the user to select a contact from the address book, then generates a QR code with it.

## Scan QR Code
This takes the generated QR code, looks up the encoded person from the address book, then displays information about that contact.
